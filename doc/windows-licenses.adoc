= Windows Licenses

== Trial

Trial versions of Windows use a different .ISO. You can find them here:

// TODO

If you want to use a trial version make sure you have the following in your
`config.json`:

    "trial": true

== Registered

Specify your product key in your `config.json` file. For example:

    "trial": false,
    "product_key": "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"

For registered versions the following ISOs are known to work:

=== Windows 7 32 bits

* filename: en_windows_7_professional_with_sp1_x86_dvd_u_677056.iso
* sha1 checksum: d89937df3a9bc2ec1a1486195fd308cd3dade928

=== Volume licensing

Volume license install keys are available from Microsoft here:

These are untested. Please report if they work or not and if they require a
different ISO.
