* Make work with trial ISOs

== Minimal malware analist use case

* push sample w/ IDA debugger
* open ports for remote IDA debugging
* vagrant no net, NAT
* vagrant update box + send on network (archiving)
* vagrant team workflow
* git malware analysis template integrated with malboxes

=== inetsim json config

		"vboxmanage_post": [
			["modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--nic1", "intnet"],
			["modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--intnet1", "malwarelab"]
		],

== Install process

* Make easily customizable in `Autounattend.xml`
** license key
** computer name
** username
** NetworkLocation: Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup | OOBE | NetworkLocation (Win7 at least)

* Concept of pre-built profiles: Work (crimeware/APTs?) vs Home (crimeware)

== Improvements to Autounattend.xml

* Perform automatic updates on initial setup
* Automatic updates configuration (disabled/enabled)
