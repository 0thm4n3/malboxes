		"vboxmanage_post": [
			["modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--nic1", "intnet"],
			["modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--intnet1", "malwarelab"]
		],

== Install process

* Make easily customizable in `Autounattend.xml`
** license key
** computer name
** username
** NetworkLocation: Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup | OOBE | NetworkLocation (Win7 at least)

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
